The system now:\n- Calculates optimal number of columns/rows based on ~50px target\n- Computes exact tile size (width/cols) for perfect fit\n- Adapts to any screen size while maintaining square tiles\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
